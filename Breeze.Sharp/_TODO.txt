- Add good message for AuthorizedThreadId check and how to turn it off for unit tests - Only partially implemented currently.
- ProbeAssemblies should default to not searching Breeze.Sharp.
- ComplexType inheritance. ( missing in Breeze.js as well )
- Think about NamingConvention per DataService instead of one global one.


Metadata mapping - Handle these cases:
--------------------------------------
1.	Metadata type with no matching CLR type – log it and ignore it.
2.	Metadata data or navigation property where CLR type does not have a matching property – log it and ignore it. 
3.	Metadata data or navigation property mismatch ( any fundamental constraint mismatch – i.e. datatype, isScalar) – log and throw after metadata is complete

4.	CLR entity type not found in metadata – do nothing – it may appear later. 
5.	CLR property not found in metadata – becomes an unmapped property
