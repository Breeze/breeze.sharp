# Breeze.Sharp

### Welcome to **Breeze.Sharp** by [**IdeaBlade**](http://www.ideablade.com "IdeaBlade website"), the data management library for developers of rich client applications written in  **C#, F#, and VB.NET**.

**Breeze** is a library that helps you manage data in rich client applications. If you store data in a database, query and save those data as complex object graphs, and share these graphs across multiple screens of your JavaScript or C# client, Breeze is for you.

Client-side querying, caching, dynamic object graphs, change tracking and notification, model validation, batch save, offline â€¦ all part of rich data management with Breeze.  Breeze clients communicate with any remote service that speaks HTTP and JSON.

**Breeze** lets you develop applications using the same powerful idioms on the client and server. You can

- query with a rich query syntax
- navigate the graph of related entities
- track changes as you add/change/delete entities
- perform client-side validation
- save all changes in a single transaction
- use the same entity model on the server and client

Breeze.Sharp is a data management tool for smart client apps.  It retrieves data from the server using a rich query language, 
manages the entity graph of application data, tracks changes, and performs updates of changed data to the server.
